# Lab 02: Ingest data with a pipeline

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to use Data Factory pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to implement data ingestion solutions. You will create a pipeline that uses a Copy Data activity to copy data from an external source into your lakehouse, and then use a Spark notebook to transform the ingested data and load it into a table. Finally, you will modify the pipeline to include the notebook as part of the workflow.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

 - Task 1: Create a Subfolder in lakehouse
 - Task 2: Create a pipeline
 - Task 3: Create a notebook
 - Task 4: Modify the pipeline

## Use Data Factory pipelines in Microsoft Fabric

A data lakehouse is a common analytical data store for cloud-scale analytics solutions. One of the core tasks of a data engineer is to implement and manage the ingestion of data from multiple operational data sources into the lakehouse. In Microsoft Fabric, you can implement *extract, transform, and load* (ETL) or *extract, load, and transform* (ELT) solutions for data ingestion through the creation of *pipelines*.

Fabric also supports Apache Spark, enabling you to write and run code to process data at scale. By combining the pipeline and Spark capabilities in Fabric, you can implement complex data ingestion logic that copies data from external sources into the OneLake storage on which the lakehouse is based, and then uses Spark code to perform custom data transformations before loading it into tables for analysis.

## Task 1: Create a Subfolder in lakehouse

In this task, you will create subfolder in the existing lakehouse.

1. On the menu bar on the left, select the **Lakehouse** created earlier.

1. On the **Explorer** pane on the left, in the **... (1)** menu for the **Files** node, select **New subfolder (2)**.

## Task 2: Create a pipeline

In this task, you will create a pipeline in Microsoft Fabric to ingest data into your lakehouse. You will use the Copy Data activity to extract data from a source and copy it into a subfolder within the lakehouse, forming the foundation for an ETL or ELT process.

1. On the **Home** page for your lakehouse, select **Get data (1)** and then select **New copy job (2)**.

    ![Screen picture showing auto generated code and data.](./Images/dp700-lab1-06.png)

    - Create a new data copy job named **Ingest Sales Data (3)** and then **Create (4)**.

      ![Screen picture showing auto generated code and data.](./Images/dp700-lab1-07.png)

1. If the **Copy job** wizard doesn't open automatically, select **Copy Data > Use copy assistant** in the pipeline editor page.

1. In the **Copy job** wizard, on the **Choose data source** page, enter **HTTP (1)** in the search bar and then select **HTTP (2)** in the **New sources** section.

## Task 3: Create a notebook

In this task, you will create a notebook in Microsoft Fabric to begin processing your ingested data using PySpark. You’ll write code to load sales data, apply transformations, and save the results as a table in the lakehouse—enabling further analysis or reporting through SQL or visualization tools.

1. On the **Home** page for your lakehouse, in the **Open notebook (1)** menu, select **New notebook (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/4t3-1.png)

     >**Note**: After a few seconds, a new notebook containing a single *cell* will open. Notebooks are made up of one or more cells that can contain *code* or *markdown* (formatted text).

1. Select the existing cell in the notebook, which contains some simple code, and then replace the default code with the following variable declaration.

    ```python
   table_name = "sales"
    ```

1. In the **... (1)** menu for the cell (at its top-right) select **Toggle parameter cell (2)**. This configures the cell so that the variables declared in it are treated as parameters when running the notebook from a pipeline.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/dpp37.png)

1. Run the cell.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/pd8.png)

1. Under the parameters cell, use the **+ Code** button to add a new code cell. Then add the following code to it:

    ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import *

   # Read the new sales data
   df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header","true").load("Files/new_data/*.csv")

   ## Add month and year columns
   df = df.withColumn("Year", year(col("OrderDate"))).withColumn("Month", month(col("OrderDate")))

   # Derive FirstName and LastName columns
   df = df.withColumn("FirstName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(0)).withColumn("LastName", split(col("CustomerName"), " ").getItem(1))

   # Filter and reorder columns
   df = df["SalesOrderNumber", "SalesOrderLineNumber", "OrderDate", "Year", "Month", "FirstName", "LastName", "EmailAddress", "Item", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxAmount"]

   # Load the data into a table
   df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(table_name)
    ```

    This code loads the data from the sales.csv file that was ingested by the **Copy Data** activity, applies some transformation logic, and saves the transformed data as a table - appending the data if the table already exists.

1. Verify that your notebooks looks similar to this, and then use the **&#9655; Run all** button on the toolbar to run all of the cells it contains.

    ![Screenshot of a notebook with a parameters cell and code to transform data.](./Images/dp700-lab1-17.png)

    > **Note**: Since this is the first time you've run any Spark code in this session, the Spark pool must be started. This means that the first cell can take a minute or so to complete.

1. When the notebook run has completed, in the **Lakehouse explorer** pane on the left, in the **...** menu for **Tables** select **Refresh** and verify that a **sales** table has been created.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/dpp38.png)

1. In the notebook menu bar, use the ⚙️ **Settings** icon to view the notebook settings.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/dpp39.png)

1. Then set the **Name** of the notebook to **Load Sales (1)** and close the settings pane **(2)**.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/4t3-8.png)

1. In the hub menu bar on the top, select your lakehouse **lakehouse<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. In the **Explorer** pane, refresh the view. Then expand **Tables (1)**, and select the **sales (2)** table to see a preview of the data it contains **(3)**.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/4t3-10.png)

## Task 4: Modify the pipeline

In this task, you will modify your existing pipeline to include the notebook you created for data transformation. By integrating the notebook into the pipeline, you’ll build a reusable and automated ETL process that extracts data, runs Spark-based transformations, and loads the results into a lakehouse table.

1. In the hub menu bar on the left select the **Ingest Sales Data** copy job you created previously.

    ![Screenshot of a pipeline with a Copy Data activity.](./Images/pd9.png)

1. Click on **Add to pipeline**.
